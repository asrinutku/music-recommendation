Item based music recommender with KNN algorithm .

**Content-Based Filtering System Description**
- Finding all pairs of content that have been evaluated by the same user.
- A measurement of the evaluations of two people who watched the same content according to the similarities of the reviews.
- Sort by content first, then by similarity.

**Content Based Suggestion System Introduction**
- It is basically classified as a growth and continuation of information filtering research. In this system, objects are mainly defined by their associated properties. A contextual suggestive learns a profile of the new user's interests based on the properties found in the objects the user has rated. It's basically a keyword specific recommendation system where keywords are used to describe items. Thus, the algorithms used in a content-based recommendation system are such that they suggest similar items to users that they have liked in the past or are currently viewing.

**KNN**
- K-Nearest Neighbors is a machine learning technique and algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. K-Nearest Neighbors examine the labels of a selected number of data points surrounding a target data point to make a guess about the class to which the data point belongs. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is conceptually a simple but very powerful algorithm and for these reasons it is one of the most popular learning algorithms.
